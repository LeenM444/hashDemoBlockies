# Hash Demo using Blockies
![MyBlockie](https://github.com/LeenM444/hashDemoBlockies/blob/master/MyBlockie.png)

I forked Hash Demo from johntango.  It shows how hashes can be used to create document signatures. The Blockies is a pixel representation that makes it easier for the human to recognize particular hashes.

To make your own:

1) Go to https://github.com/johntango/hashDemoBlockies
2) Choose the green "Code" button and from the pull-down menu choose to "Clone" using your SSH key and copy the URL
3) Go to your local Git (I use Gitbash from Windows Terminal) and type "git clone " and then paste the URL
4) Go to your IDE (I use Visual Studio) and open the folder where you saved the demo
5) Open a blank tab on your Internet browser and drag the hashDemoBlockies.html file to it
6) Enter your name into the "Input Text" field and the Blockies will show below
